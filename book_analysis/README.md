# book_analysis

 This repository contains the analysis of 'El amante japones', a book written by Isabel Allende. The main goal is to perform a lexical and a character-based analysis of the book by using netwrok analysis, natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

 The book was initially downloaded from a pdf and the characters will be obtained from the text by fine-tuning a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. Later, a network of the character's interactions will be created and further analysed.
